            <h1>Welcome to Comcast&#39;s Pre-Interview Questionnaire!</h1>
            <p>
              Interviewing candidates takes a lot of time, and time is valuable for all of us.
              If you are as serious about working for Comcast as we are about working with great people,
              please take the time to fill out this questionnaire. We devised these questions as a test of
              skills we consider primary and fundamental.
            </p>

            <h2>Instructions:</h2>
            <b>-</b> Read and work on the problems in a text/html editor. It will make a lot more sense that way.<br>
            <b>-</b> Do not use any Javascript or CSS frameworks.<br>
            <b>-</b> Work on this alone. Feel free to use google or any reference material you have.<br>
            <b>-</b> If you can&#39;t solve a problem, comment on it.<br><br>

                you can go back and fix it. I have been using Git as my source control tool.
